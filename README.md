# Table-Conditional-Formatter
Changes the colour of negative integers in a HTML table to red

Implement this script in your HTML document and the negative values of a specified table will be shown in red (See exaple.html).
This was done for Leon T. after he requested it.

## Usage ##
Every table that is a member of the class "format" will automatically be formatted when the page loads. Implement the script right before the body closes. The function to update every table on your page is called format()
